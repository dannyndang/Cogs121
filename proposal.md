# Project Title: Ghost Tag

### Imagine trying to find a ghost. What's your lead? Steps. That's all you get.

### Storyboard:

### Peer Feedback: 
Based on peer feedback we decided to combine ideas from our many different storyboards. For our ideas Pathfinder and Campus Rider, people thought it would be useful, but had no longevity. People do like the routes and tracking where people go however. GuessingGame and GeoCache had generally positive feedback. The latter two ideas aren't particularly unique. That is why we decided to combine these four storyboard ideas together. We want to create a hide and seek style game that includes guessing location and/or finding other participants. Peers also stated that there needs to be a range, so the ranger can be a whole campus or a mall. It depends on the game rules that we have yet to develop. Overall, feedback was that the storyboard ideas are simple, but bare. By combining the ideas and turning it into a game we came up with Ghost Tag.

### Proposed features: 
Ghost Tag will be a hide and seek style game in which one person is the ghost and one person is the seeker. Players can create a game room that specifies conditions like range of gameplay(such as campus, mall) and duration. To actually present a challenge for the seeker, the ghost's steps will be delayed. The map it will only show where the ghost HAD been and not current position. (Ghost idea is similar to Marauder's Map from Harry Potter or Mario Party mini-games). There are two ways for the seeker to win: either find the ghost by overlaping locations, OR if the seeker gets close in proximity, a circle will pop up and the seeker and guess the ghost's location (limited guesses). For the ghost to win, they just need to avoid the seeker. We plan to add power ups, boons and banes, different conditions, and other common video game features to make the experience less bare boned.
